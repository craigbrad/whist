Here's the basic process:

* add players, set rounds, create game

* scoreboard appears

* app tells you to split -- asks for dealer

* app tells you how many cards to deal

* app asks you what trump is and who is trump picker

* app asks for bids from each person

* app then allows you to enter contracts for each person

* app has "next round" button then repeats from above

====

* auto pick trump picker
* auto enter 0 after contracts entered (based on num available)
* highlight places (1st, 2nd, etc)
* sort order for players at top
* indicate whether split or not (highlight same contracts, winning contract)
* auto-focus on next bid/contracts input based on player order
* keep players/rounds (trump/picker/num) fixed so you can scroll on smaller devices
* add dependent callbacks to models (then clean up db)
